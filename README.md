#Process Scheduling Algorithm Project
Introduction
This project implements two process scheduling algorithms: First Come First Serve (FCFS) and Round Robin (RR). The goal of this project is to collect data about these algorithms and compare their results. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been added to visualize the FCFS and RR algorithms in action.

Features
Implementation of First Come First Serve (FCFS) algorithm using a priority queue.
Implementation of Round Robin (RR) algorithm with various time slices and context switches using a min heap.
A graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing the FCFS and RR algorithms.

Getting Started
To try out the project, you can download the executable JAR file provided in this repository.

Prerequisites
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system.
Running the Application
Download the process-scheduling.jar file from this repository.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the JAR file.
Run the following command to execute the application:
shell
Copy code
java -jar process-scheduling.jar (or simply double click the executeable file in your file explorer)

Using the GUI
Once the application is running, you can use the GUI to:

Start and stop the First Come First Serve (FCFS) algorithm.
Adjust parameters for the Round Robin (RR) algorithm, such as time slices and context switches.
Visualize the execution of both algorithms.
Collect and compare data about the scheduling performance.
